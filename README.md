# Cryptic-Dictionary
A Cryptic Dictionary for MacOS Dictionay app. 

This is a cryptic crossword dictionary for MacOS. It has abbreviations, and some indicators for things like reversals, anagrams, hiddens and homophones. 

You can put the "Crossword Dictionary.dictionary" folder in you ~/Library/Dictionaries/ directory and then open the Dictionary app. 
In Dictionary Preferences you will have to tick the box to use the Crossword Dictionary to have the entries show up. 

This is the initial effort and the formatting can be a little rough
